# Exodomus Chronicles: Lumina Perdida  
**An On-Chain Loreverse Powered by Zora & Collective Memory**

---

### 🌌 Overview  
**Exodomus Chronicles** is a decentralized, interactive storytelling experiment set in a fragmented cyberpunk city—**Lumina Perdida**—where citizens’ memories were stolen and encoded as NFTs. This project fuses emotional worldbuilding, NFT mechanics, and Web3 community to let players recover their identity and reshape the future.

By blending **Zora’s minting tools**, **Mirror’s publishing**, and a custom **onboarding system**, users become memory-reclaimers—choosing a side in a centuries-old war between **truth and control**.

---

### 🔍 MVP Purpose  
The MVP serves as a **narrative onboarding layer** and a minimal but functional **Web3 storytelling portal**, built to test our mechanics and grow our early community.

Key Features:
- 🧠 **Onboarding Quiz (15 Qs):** Assigns users to a faction and generates a custom **Memory Tag** that defines their starting rank and lore alignment.
- 🧩 **Memory NFT Mechanics:** Each mint reveals a **fragmented story**—memories that can be **combined, burned, and reconstructed** to unlock deeper lore.
- 🌀 **Faction System:** Choose between **Los Recordantes** (the resistance trying to restore truth) and **El Gran Dolor** (the authoritarian regime that erased the past).
- 🖼️ **Glitchy Alebrije & Lotería Aesthetics:** Every memory is embodied as a haunting artifact of emotion and lost identity.
- 🧭 **Minimal UI with Chakra:** The MVP uses Chakra UI to offer clean access to lore, memory minting, and faction onboarding, without the need for Tailwind.

### 🎭 Story Highlights  
- **Setting:** Lumina Perdida, a broken city built on forgotten dreams, rich in Latinx culture, cyberpunk energy, and digital ruins.

### 🧠 Design Philosophy  
> Simple mechanics. Deep lore. Emotional tech.

Every choice, memory, and mint is designed to pull users deeper into a **living narrative**—a collective attempt to reclaim what was lost using the power of **on-chain memory**.

---

### 🚀 Vision  
This MVP is just **Episode Zero** of a broader **on-chain transmedia universe**, where memory becomes governance, puzzles drive collaboration, and every participant becomes part of the story.

Whether you're a dev, creative, writer, or just curious, Exodomus is a world you don't just visit—you **unlock**.

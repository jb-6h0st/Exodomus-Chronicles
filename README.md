# Exodomus Chronicles: Lumina Perdida

An experimental Web3 interactive storytelling experience, where memories are NFTs, and the community rebuilds a forgotten cyberpunk city.

## ‚ú® Project Overview
Exodomus Chronicles: Lumina Perdida is more than a story; it's a movement.

Set in a future where authoritarian control has erased the very memories that made people human, Lumina Perdida invites the community to rebuild a forgotten city through collective memory and decentralized action.

In a world devastated by centralization and manipulation, only the decentralized spirit remains unbroken.
Each NFT minted in Exodomus Chronicles is not just a collectible, it's a lost memory, a fragment of someone's life, a cry for freedom.
By holding, connecting, and restoring these memories, players reclaim what was stolen: their stories, their emotions, and their right to remember.

Exodomus Chronicles stands as a powerful advocate for decentralization.
Through on-chain storytelling and community-driven narrative building, it challenges the idea that power should ever be centralized again.

This project merges cyberpunk storytelling, Web3 technology, and collective ownership to create a living, evolving city, one memory at a time.

üåå In Lumina Perdida, the past is fragmented, but the future belongs to those who remember.

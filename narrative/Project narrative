EXODOMUS CHRONICLES: Lumina Perdida

A cyberpunk loreverse powered by Solana.



🧠 What is Exodomus Chronicles?
Exodomus Chronicles: Lumina Perdida is an interactive, community-driven storytelling experience. Set in a dystopian Latin-inspired cyberpunk city, players uncover lost memories stored on-chain as NFTs, building the story together in real time.

🌆 The World
Fifteen years ago, the oppressive regime El Gran Dolor erased the memories of millions to crush a growing resistance. Now, fragments of those memories, encoded as NFTs begin to resurface. You, a new Recordante, must piece them together to uncover the truth and revive the rebellion.

🎭 Key Characters
- 6h0st: A masked figure from the original resistance who returns with a mysterious hard wallet.
- Los Recordantes: A network of rebels and truth-seekers.
- El Gran Dolor: The central authority who controls Lumina Perdida by suppressing memory and history.
